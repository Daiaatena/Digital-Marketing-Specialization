2. What do you think of the Rally Fighter? Will this new car be successful? Why or why not?
In my opinion ,Rally Fighter will be successful because the concept itself it's new and unique . However,the success will be on short term because the car it is quite expensive and I believe that not so many people will be willing to pay for it ,but there will be certain people who will buy it mostly because it is the first car designed and built by an online community. The car  has grown in popularity also because it was featured in the movies Transformers and Fate of the Furious.
