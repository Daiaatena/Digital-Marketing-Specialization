Respond to the question: Why did you select to make/edit an entry about this topic?

I made an entry on my hometown page about  the "Constantin Brancusi" University where I am studying for a career in Economics.It is named after the famous artist Constantin Brancusi who was born in Targu-Jiu.It was a topic that I thought it will be interesting for other people to know about it. Although we can say it is a newly established university (it was founded in 1992 ), today the university counts 25 study programs for the Bachelor's Degree and 20 master's specializations.

Respond to the question: What did you learn about User Generated Content from this exercise?
From this exercise I learned that UGC is a very useful tool used in the digital marketing area.It may by used  not only by employees and costumers of a company but also as we were able to see by users of a digital platform such as Wikipedia.Basically User Generated Content is used by unpaid contributors.Everyone who has a connection to the internet and some knowledge in a particular area of interest is able to share the  information among people,communities or organizations . The content must be of high quality otherwise it may not be accepted .User Generated Content can refer to customer feedback,reviews ,pictures,videos posted on blogs,social media pages (Facebook,Twitter,Instagram etc)
