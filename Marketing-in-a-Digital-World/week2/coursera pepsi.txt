Was the Pepsi Refresh Project succesfull?Why or why not?
The purpose of the Pepsi Refresh Project was to help people all over the world by funding their ideas.They took a risk  by redirecting the annual budget from Super Bowl to this campaign and even though they  received a lot of submissions and their newly created website reached over 18 millions visitors the project in the end wasn't very successful because Pepsi's sales were actually lower after that campaign. In my opinion Pepsi wanted  to adopt a new and different promotional strategy and by offering grants for the best ideas they thought that will get more customers. The campaign was focused on social causes and building trust with the communities instead of focusing in increasing their sales.The project itself wasn't bad but it lack authenticity because Pepsi brand is focused on fun and youth so they should have focused on these things more.

What should Pepsi do about this project?
I think Pepsi should consider to start again the project but first of all they need to think to a better approach.Even though the project was successful according to  social media ,the financial data showed that their sales didn't increase after conducting this project.They need to focus more on the brand and be more authentic.Social causes projects have a huge positive impact in the society but it is also risky because people may be willing to reduce sugary drink consumption therefore sales may decrease.In my opinion starting a campaign that is based on the idea of doing good for the community it lacks authenticity and  is opposite with the product itself ; actually consuming soda it wouldn't do any good to our health.
