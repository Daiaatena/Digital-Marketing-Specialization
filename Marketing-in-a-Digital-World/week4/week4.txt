Task 1

Share the information below for each of the five products (coffee, detergent, men’s T-shirt, battery, television):
•	Brand name
•	Store price
•	Lowest local retail price
•	Lowest Internet retail price
CATEGORY	             BRAND	STORE	LOCAL	INTERNET
COFFEE	JACOBS KRONUNG 	14.39 RON	14 RON	24.50 RON
DETERGENT       	         PERSIL	42 RON	39 RON	45.99 RON
T-SHIRT	       LACOSTE	269 RON	269 RON	249.99 RON
BATTERY	       DURACELL	21.90 RON	21 RON	20.42 RON
TELEVISION	       SAMSUNG	1.449,90 RON	1399,90 RON	1390,00 RON
TOTAL	 	1797,19 RON	1742,90 RON	1730,00 RON

Task 2
Calculate the total amount of money you would have saved by buying these items via an Internet retailer (not counting the cost of shipping). What did you learn from this?
Local prices were in general the cheapest except for the T-Shirt and Television prices which I found that they were cheaper online.The total amount of money spent was: 
-Store :1797,19 RON,
-Local :1742,90 RON
-Internet: 1730,00 RON 
If I would have bought all the products via an Internet retailer and not from the store I would have saved 67 RON.
From this experience I learned that online prices are not always cheaper than offline and if you add the shipping cost it will result the same prices as in the local stores.

Task 3
Respond to the question: How did you feel about using this shopping tool? Will you use it in the future? How will you use it?
For this exercise I used the Compari.ro app.The application provides us with up-to-date information about the selected products ,we can scan the bar codes and compare prices ,existing stocks,reviews and also store information such as direct dialing,route calculation,map listing.
It was my first time using this shopping tool and I think it was a great experience. I will definitely use it in the future in order to  make smarter choices that will allow me to save money when I go shopping.

Task 4
Respond to the question: How could this tool be enhanced? What would make it even more valuable?
In my opinion the app is easy to use ,but sometimes it crashes and I have to close it and then start again with the scanning so it needs to be fixed.Also I noticed that I couldn't find every product by scanning the bar code and some items were not even listed therefore I couldn't find any information about them.
I think that it will be great if all the products and all the offers from both physical stores and online stores can be found through this app.
Using location technology to notify users of offers from the selected store it would make it more valuable.
