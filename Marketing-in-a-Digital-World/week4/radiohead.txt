1.In my opinion the Pay What You Want strategy adopted by Radiohead was a success because even though many people downloaded the album for free ,the strategy itself still generated an increase in sales($3m).Considering that Radiohead ended their contract with the recording company, if  they would have chosen to sell their album through a distribution partner or an online music store such as iTunes they would have only earned a small percent of total sales. Radiohead is one of the most popular rock band in the world that means they already have an audience therefore a lot of fans which made this concept profitable.By implementing this new and innovative technique their popularity grew even more and they gained not only a lot of attention but also new fans.
2. Radiohead could use the money for a better promotion in the future that can lead to better profit  and also donate a part of sales to charity.
3.I believe that PWYW strategy can be employed by more traditional firms in order to increase popularity, attention of the press and to gain new customers or to build better trust with the older ones.This strategy works better in the digital area because it has lower risks,therefore traditional firms should not implement it for a long period of time or a large customer segment.
