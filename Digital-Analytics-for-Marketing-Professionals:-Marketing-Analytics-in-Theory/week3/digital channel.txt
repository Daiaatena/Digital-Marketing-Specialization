In my opinion the video channel is the most effective because today there are a lot of vloggers  that share their content through Youtube platform.They always want the audience to like ,share and subscribe because growing their channel means more popularity.Also people who makes videos need to be able to verify if the content is appreciate by the viewers and to gain their trust. Making a good content and building a loyal online community is very important because brands tend to promote their products by collaborating with popular Youtubers. For example Philips which is a company focused on improving people's lives through innovation often collaborates with beauty bloggers and vloggers to promote their new products .Romanian beauty blogger ,Alina Ceusan, along with others local influencers upload video tutorials to test the brand's new products and offers giveaways or different contests for the audience to be able to test before they actually buy the product.
A second example could be Nivea which is a German personal care brand that specializes in body -care. This company also teams up with beauty influencers  to front their new campaigns and to produce and publish videos for their channels.
In the beauty segment online communication is very important especially through video tutorials.
