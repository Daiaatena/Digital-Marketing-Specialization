The article "New Ways Marketers Are Manipulating Data to Influence You" talks about retargeting, a new form of targeted advertising that collects and analyzes personal information (such as credit card histories and web habits) to display personalized ads to consumers. 

 Discuss whether you are personally in favor of the retargeting technique to achieve targeted ads. Explain the rationale behind your opinion.

Retargeting is a technique used by companies to re-attract visitors for example who visited a website in order to buy a product and then left the page without buying anything.The visitor of that website will be targeted with multiple and relevant ads  as he moves from site to site.
In my opinion retargeting technique has advantages and also disadvantages. I am personally in favor of this method to achieve targeted ads because for  marketers is important to attract consumers who are looking towards their products. It does not mean necessarily that those targeted people will buy a product when they see an ad if they don't need it , but it certainly make them think more about to click a website and to purchase or not. On the other hand ,I don't think it is fair that personal information can be accessed without the permission of a customer . Commenting on a facebook post or on a blog, tracking web history or purchase information aren't anymore protected as a customer may think .If a law protecting those information will be applied ,companies will need to rethink this strategy because will no longer be efficient.
Retargeting technique is also not very cheap, it depends on how much every marketer is willing to pay for it but overall I think it is a good method to attract customers .
